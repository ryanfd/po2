                <h3 class="event-heading">Chocolate Making Class</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date: December 11th, 2019</li>

                <p>Our master chefs invite you to join them to learn how we make our chocolate. After honing their craft for years, we feel that it is important for our chefs to share their knowledge. Making chocolate is an extremely fun and social event that is best done with a partner or a group. So bring a partner or two and dive into the science of chocolate.</p>
